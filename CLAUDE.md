# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Fiducia is a React Native app (Expo, TypeScript, expo-router) for comparing investment portfolios, targeting both iOS and Android. `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-portfolio-comparison-design.md` is the approved design spec and remains the source of truth for architecture decisions not covered below. `docs/plans/backend-foundation.md`, referenced by the spec, does not exist in this repo — treat the spec as authoritative where the two would conflict.

## Architecture

Strict layering, enforced by convention rather than tooling — don't skip a layer:

- **`src/app/`** — expo-router file-based routes only. Each route file is a thin wrapper that renders the matching component from `src/screens/`; it holds no logic of its own (see `src/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`). `src/app/_layout.tsx` sets up the root `Stack` (tabs + modal routes for `add-portfolio`/`add-ticker`) and the app-wide `QueryClient`.
- **`src/screens/`** — one directory per screen (`overview`, `compare`, `watchlist`, `account`, `add-portfolio`, `add-ticker`), each with an `index.tsx`. This is where actual UI composition and screen-level state live.
- **`src/components/`** — shared presentational components (`tab-bar`, `period-pills`, `performance-chart`, `watchlist-row`, `empty-state`, `icons`).
- **`src/lib/api/`** — the only layer screens/components may call for data. Wraps `src/lib/storage/*` (SQLite) and `src/lib/compute/*` (pure math) behind a stable interface (`portfolios.ts`, `watchlist.ts`, `marketData.ts`, `types.ts`). This indirection exists because a v2 Supabase migration is anticipated — UI code must never import `expo-sqlite` or call the market-data fetcher directly.
- **`src/lib/storage/`** — expo-sqlite access. `db.ts` owns the singleton connection, schema (`portfolios`, `holdings`, `prices`, `watchlist` tables) and seeds the two benchmark portfolios (90/10, 60/40) on first open. `portfolios.ts`/`prices.ts`/`watchlist.ts` are per-table query modules.
- **`src/lib/compute/`** — pure, unit-tested functions for return/volatility/max-drawdown/Sharpe (`returns.ts`, `risk.ts`), alpha/beta/correlation (`regression.ts`), and chart point layout (`chartGeometry.ts`). No I/O; computed in-memory on demand from the raw price cache — there is no precomputed stats cache.
- **`src/theme/colors.ts`** — design tokens extracted from the mock (see "Matching the mock exactly" below).
- Path alias `@/*` → `./src/*` (kept in sync between `tsconfig.json` and `jest.config.js` — see Automated tests).

Key behavioral decisions:

- **Local-only v1**: no backend/auth. All persistence is expo-sqlite.
- **Market data**: Alpha Vantage `TIME_SERIES_DAILY`, delta-fetched (only the missing tail per ticker, via `getLatestDate`/`upsertPrices`) to stay under free-tier quota, with cached data served on fetch failure/offline (see `getLatestPrice` in `src/lib/api/portfolios.ts` and the equivalent in `watchlist.ts` for the once-a-day refresh cap and stale-cache fallback pattern).
  - **`outputsize=full` is a premium-only feature on Alpha Vantage's free tier** — confirmed by calling it directly; it returns 200 OK with an `Information` field (not `Note`, which is the rate-limit signal) explaining the paywall. `outputsize=compact` (the only usable free option) always returns just the last ~100 trading days, full stop — there is no free way to get more via this endpoint. `PeriodKey` in `src/lib/api/types.ts` is capped to `1D`/`7D`/`30D`/`3M` for exactly this reason; don't add longer periods (1Y/5Y/MAX/YTD) without a plan to either pull from a different data source or accumulate history day-by-day over real time. `fetchDailySeries` in `src/lib/api/marketData.ts` checks for `Information` and throws so a paywall response can't be silently swallowed and misreported as a working longer-period fetch.
- **State management**: TanStack Query for async data through `src/lib/api/*`; plain React state for local UI state (active tab/portfolio/period). No Zustand/Redux.
- **Screens**: 4-tab shell (Overview/Compare/Watchlist/Account) plus an Add Portfolio and Add Ticker flow, per the "Nocturne" dark-theme mockups. `Portfolio Tracker.html` at the repo root is a bundled export of that mockup set — a visual reference, not app code.

## Commands

- `npm start` — start the Expo dev server (Metro); scan the QR code with Expo Go or press `i`/`a` in the terminal.
- `npm run ios` — start the dev server and launch the iOS simulator.
- `npm run android` — start the dev server and launch the Android emulator.
- `npm run web` — start the dev server for web.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — type-check the project (there is no separate `lint`/`build` script defined yet).
- `npm test` — run the Jest unit tests (`src/lib/compute/*.test.ts`). Pass a path to run one file, e.g. `npm test -- src/lib/compute/risk.test.ts`.

## Important: Expo SDK version

This project is on **Expo SDK 57**, which is a recent major version with breaking changes from prior SDKs. Before writing Expo-related code (config, APIs, plugins), consult the versioned docs at https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v57.0.0/ rather than relying on general Expo knowledge, since APIs and conventions may have changed.

## Matching the mock exactly

`Portfolio Tracker.html` at the repo root is the source of truth for visual design (colors, type scale, spacing, component styles, icons) — not the prose in the design spec doc, which doesn't carry exact hex codes or pixel values. Its real markup is a JSON-escaped JS string wrapped in bundler boilerplate; skimming the outer wrapper is not enough to find the actual mock content.

**`docs/mock-reference.html` is the already-decoded plain HTML** — read this directly instead of re-decoding `Portfolio Tracker.html` from scratch. It has one `data-screen-label` block per screen (`"Nocturne Detail"`, `"Nocturne Compare"`, `"Nocturne Tab Shell"` — which nests Overview/Watchlist/Account/Add Portfolio's normal and empty states — and `"Nocturne Add Portfolio"`); grep for the label to jump to a screen's markup and pull concrete tokens (hex colors, font sizes/weights, border/radius values, exact icon SVG paths, literal copy) before writing or reviewing any styling code. If `Portfolio Tracker.html` is ever updated, regenerate this file the same way it was produced: extract the JSON string inside `<script type="__bundler/template">...</script>` and `json.loads` it to get plain HTML (`python3 -c "import json; ..."`). Do not build UI from memory of "how this kind of app usually looks."

## Verifying UI changes

`npx tsc --noEmit` and a successful Metro bundle only prove the code compiles — they do not prove it renders correctly. Do not report a UI task as done without actually looking at it running in the simulator (screenshot via `xcrun simctl io booted screenshot`), and check *every* screen/state touched by the change, not just the first one — a passing type-check previously shipped a broken bottom tab bar (see gotcha below) that went unnoticed because only one screen was screenshotted.

**Gotcha**: `expo-router/ui`'s `<TabTrigger asChild>` injects a default Radix Slot style (`flexDirection: 'row', justifyContent: 'space-between'`) onto whatever child it wraps. If a custom tab-bar-button component spreads that incoming `style` prop after its own styles (directly, or via `{...props}` where `style` wasn't destructured out first), it silently overrides intended layout (e.g. turns a centered icon-over-label column into a squashed, misaligned row) with no type error and no crash — only visible by looking at the rendered screen. When wrapping `asChild` children from `expo-router/ui`, either don't forward the injected `style` at all, or merge it with your own styles *first* in the array so your styles win on conflicting keys.

**Gotcha**: a horizontal `ScrollView` given only `contentContainerStyle` (no `style` of its own) will have its content container's cross-axis size (height, since the main axis is horizontal) match the ScrollView's own — unbounded — height when the ScrollView sits in a flex column with no sibling claiming the remaining space. Combined with the default `alignItems: 'stretch'` on the content container, every child (e.g. a row of pill buttons) stretches to fill that full height instead of sizing to its own content — pill buttons rendered as near-full-screen-height rectangles with the label pinned to the top. Fix by giving the `ScrollView` itself an explicit non-growing `style` (e.g. `{ flexGrow: 0, flexShrink: 0 }`) and setting `alignItems: 'center'` on `contentContainerStyle`. Like the `TabTrigger` gotcha above, this produces no type error and no crash — it's only visible in a screenshot.

**Gotcha**: any screen with a top-anchored header (title/eyebrow row, action buttons) needs `useSafeAreaInsets().top` folded into its top padding — a static `paddingTop: 20` overlaps the status bar/dynamic island on notched devices. `tab-bar.tsx` already does this correctly for the bottom inset; mirror that pattern for headers. This bug can hide for a while: a screen that only ever renders centered content (e.g. an empty state with no header) won't show it, and it only becomes visible the moment that screen gains a real top-anchored header — so re-screenshot a screen after adding a header even if the screen "worked" before.

### Driving the iOS Simulator for verification

The project has no `ios/`/`android/` native directories (see below), so verification happens through Expo Go in the Simulator, driven from the CLI/AppleScript rather than Xcode. A few things that cost real time to learn:

- **Check for an already-running Metro/Expo dev server before starting a new one** (`ps aux | grep "expo start"`) — a stale server from an earlier session holds port 8081, and `npx expo start --non-interactive` fails outright instead of prompting for a different port. Reuse the running server (`xcrun simctl openurl booted "exp://<lan-ip>:8081"` reloads the existing app) rather than fighting over the port.
- **`CI=1`/`--non-interactive` puts Metro in a mode with file watching disabled** ("reloads are disabled"). Code changes made while Metro is running in that mode will *not* be picked up by reopening the app — the bundle is stale even though the JS on disk is correct. If you need edit → verify loops, run Metro without `CI=1`.
- **`.env` changes require a full Metro restart**, not just a reload — `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` vars are read and inlined when the dev server starts, not per-bundle.
- **Deep links are far more reliable than tap-simulation for navigating to a specific screen**: `xcrun simctl openurl booted "exp://<lan-ip>:8081/--/<route-path>"` jumps straight to an expo-router route and is the preferred way to screenshot a screen that isn't reachable from the default landing tab, or to sidestep an unreliable tap sequence entirely.
- **`xcrun simctl` has no tap/text-input primitive.** The fallback is AppleScript driving the Simulator window via System Events (`osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to tell process "Simulator" to click at {x, y}'`, mapping device screenshot pixel coordinates into the Simulator window's point-space frame from `get {position, size} of window 1`). This works reasonably for large targets (tab bar icons) but is unreliable for small targets (~32pt buttons) and **could not reliably focus a `TextInput` at all** in this environment — clicks landed on real nested accessibility elements (confirmed via the deep AX path in the click's output) but never brought up a keyboard, and `keystroke` typed nothing. Treat any flow that requires typing into a field as something to hand off for a human smoke-test rather than something to force through simulated clicks; don't burn a long tool-call chain on coordinate-hunting.
- **There is a persistent, draggable blue gear-icon overlay in the Simulator window** (simulator/OS chrome, not part of the app) that sits in the top-right area and can visually cover app UI in that region — including small custom header buttons — making them look "missing" in a screenshot when they're actually rendering fine underneath. If a top-right element seems to have vanished after a change that shouldn't have removed it, check whether this overlay is sitting on top of it before assuming a real bug (it's draggable — a stray click can move it and reveal what's underneath).

## Automated tests

`jest.config.js` + `tsconfig.jest.json` are already set up (added alongside the watchlist compute layer) — reuse them rather than reinventing test config. Two things about this setup that aren't obvious from `tsconfig.json` alone:

- Expo's base tsconfig sets `"module": "preserve"` / `"moduleResolution": "bundler"`, which `ts-jest` (running under Node/CommonJS) cannot compile against. `tsconfig.jest.json` extends the app's `tsconfig.json` but overrides `module`/`moduleResolution` to `commonjs`/`node` and adds Jest's ambient types — `jest.config.js` points `ts-jest`'s `transform` at it.
- The app-wide `tsconfig.json` excludes `**/*.test.ts` so that `npx tsc --noEmit` (which intentionally has no Jest types, since app code should never reference `describe`/`it`/`expect`) doesn't fail on test files. `ts-jest` type-checks test files separately via `tsconfig.jest.json`, so this exclusion doesn't weaken test coverage.
- `jest.config.js` has a `moduleNameMapper` for the `@/*` path alias — Jest doesn't read `tsconfig.json`'s `paths` automatically, so this needs to stay in sync if the alias ever changes.

## Native projects

There are no checked-in `ios/`/`android/` native directories — this is a managed Expo workflow (`.gitignore` explicitly excludes `/ios` and `/android`). Don't hand-edit native project files; use `app.json` (Expo config) and Expo config plugins instead. If bare native code becomes necessary, it would require `expo prebuild`.
